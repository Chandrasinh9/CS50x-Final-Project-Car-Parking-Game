Description:-
This project is the culmination of my learning in the CS50x course. It is a car parking game created using Unreal Engine, focusing on realistic driving and parking mechanics. The game challenges players to park vehicles in increasingly difficult scenarios, honing their skills as they progress through the levels.

### Features
- Realistic Driving Mechanics: Designed to simulate accurate car movements.
- Multiple Levels: Increasingly challenging parking environments.
- Blueprint Programming: Entirely implemented using Unreal Engineâ€™s Blueprint system, requiring no prior coding knowledge.
- Immersive Visuals: Created with high-quality 3D assets and materials.


Technologies Used
Unreal Engine (Blueprints)
3D Assets for Environment and Vehicles
Level Design Tools within Unreal Engine
File Descriptions
The source code is structured as follows:

/Blueprints
Contains all the game logic implemented in Unreal Engine's Blueprint scripting system. #### You can Find this all source code in zip file!!!!
/Assets
Includes all 3D models, textures, and materials used in the game.
.uproject
The Unreal Engine project file to open and edit the game.
.uasset
Individual Unreal Engine asset files used in the project.

How to Run the Project
### Option 1: Download and Play  
- [Download the game executable from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rs1MOT8ZuBzkYkZ2YlupFqViknK9yial?usp=drive_link).  
- Extract the ZIP folder and run the `.exe` file for Windows (if available).  

### Option 2: Open in Unreal Engine  
- Download the full project source files from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rs1MOT8ZuBzkYkZ2YlupFqViknK9yial?usp=drive_link).  
- Open the `.uproject` file in Unreal Engine 4.  
- Run the game in the Unreal Engine Editor.  

Open the .uproject file in Unreal Engine 4.
Run the game in the Unreal Engine Editor.
There are many folder choose level folder, inside different level are present from 1 to 30.
You can choose any level click on it and you will find game playable in editor!
